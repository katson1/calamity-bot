  <summary> Click here if you're having problems with the command "mongod" (on Windows)</summary>
  <blockquote> 
   
    Reinstall MongoDB as usual and wait until Compass appears. If it doesn't, uninstall and reinstall. 
    Copy the installation path; we'll need it.
    Open a command prompt (cmd.exe) as an administrator.
    Type: cd C:\
    Then: md "\data\db"
    After that: "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.2\bin\mongod.exe" --dbpath="c:\data\db"
    Press "CTRL+C" and close cmd.exe.
    Copy the installation path up to the "bin" folder, for example: C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\YOUR_MONGODB_VERSION\bin
    Go to system properties and add to the system environment variables (search on Google) in "PATH":
    Double-click on PATH in "System Environment Variables".
    Click on "New"
    Paste the copied path and click OK.

Clone the project and enter the project folder.

Install required packages into the project:
  ```bash
npm install
  ```

Now copy the .env.example file to **.env** file to the project:
  ```.bash
copy .env.example .env
  ```

Now, you need to create a bot in the [discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
Click on New Applcation and give it a cool name.
On the **General Information** tab copy the APPLICATION ID and past on the CLIENT_ID variable on .env file, live this example: 

  ```.env
MONGODB_CONNECT=mongodb://localhost:27017/yourDatabaseName
TOKEN=
CLIENT_ID=0123456789876543210
  ```

Now, on the **Bot** tab click on Reset Token and generate a new `Token`. (Do not share this token!)
Copy the `token` to the .env file:

The `.env` file should be like this example:
  ```.env
MONGODB_CONNECT=mongodb://localhost:27017/yourDatabaseName
TOKEN=EXAMPLE01234TOKEN
CLIENT_ID=0123456789876543210
  ```

**THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT STEP:**

On the 'OAuth2' tab, on the session 'OAuth2 URL Generator' select `bot` and `applications.commands` then in the session 'BOT PERMISSIONS' select `Administrator` checkbox. 
This will generate the link to add the bot to a server. Paste it on a browser to add the bot to your server.

Now, run the command:
   ```js
npm start
  ```

The bot is now running, go to your server and enjoy it!
The bot can take up to 5 minutes to have the commands registered.
